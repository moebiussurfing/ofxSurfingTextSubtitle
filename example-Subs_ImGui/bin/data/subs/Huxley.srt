1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
This is Aldous Huxley, a man haunted by a vision of hell on earth.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,780
A searing social critic, Mr. Huxley, 27 years ago wrote Brave New World, a novel that predicted

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,200
that someday the entire world would live under a frightful dictatorship.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,340
Today Mr. Huxley says that his fictional world of horror is probably just around the corner

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
for all of us.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll find out why in a moment.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,760
The Mike Wallace interview, presented by the American Broadcasting Company in association

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,440
with the Fund for the Republic, brings you a special television series discussing the

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,240
problems of survival and freedom in America.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,120
Good evening, I'm Mike Wallace.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,680
Tonight's guest, Aldous Huxley, is a man of letters, as disturbing as he is distinguished.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,000
Born in England, now a resident of California, Mr. Huxley has written some of the most electric

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
novels and social criticism of this century.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,820
He's just finished a series of essays called Enemies of Freedom, in which he outlines and

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,200
defines some of the threats to our freedom in the United States.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,580
And Mr. Huxley, right off the bat, let me ask you this.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,560
As you see it, who and what are the enemies of freedom here in the United States?

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,960
Well, I don't think you can say who in the United States.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,240
I don't think there are any sinister persons deliberately trying to rob people of their

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,480
freedom.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,120
But I do think, first of all, that there are a number of impersonal forces which are pushing

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,480
in the direction of less and less freedom.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,360
And I also think that there are a number of technological devices which anybody who wishes

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,680
to use can use to accelerate this process of going away from freedom, of imposing control.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,400
What are these forces and these devices, Mr. Huxley?

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,680
I should say that there are two main impersonal forces.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,320
The first of them is not exceedingly important in the United States at the present time,

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,760
though very important in other countries.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,200
This is the force which in general terms can be called overpopulation, the mounting pressure

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,360
of population pressing upon existing resources.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
This, of course, is an extraordinary thing.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Something is happening which has never happened in the world's history before.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,120
I mean, let's just take a simple fact that between the time of the birth of Christ and

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,920
the landing of the Mayflower, the population of the Earth doubled.

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,080
It rose from 250 million to probably 500 million.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Today, the population of the Earth is rising at such a rate that it will double in half

37
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
a century.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
Well, why should overpopulation work to diminish our freedoms?

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
Well, in a number of ways.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,640
I mean, the experts in the field, like Harrison Brown, for example, pointed out that in the

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,100
underdeveloped countries, actually the standard of living is at present falling, that people

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,640
have less to eat and less goods per capita than they had 50 years ago.

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,040
And as the position of these countries, the economic position, becomes more and more precarious,

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,680
obviously the central government has to take over more and more responsibility for keeping

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,040
the ship of state on an even keel.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,600
And then, of course, you're likely to get social unrest under such conditions, with

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,120
again an intervention of the central government.

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:45,040
So I think one sees here a pattern which seems to be pushing very strongly towards a totalitarian

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
regime.

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,240
And unfortunately, as in all these underdeveloped countries, the only highly organized political

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,800
party is the Communist Party, it looks rather as though they will be the heirs to this unfortunate

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,120
process, that they will step into the position of power.

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,880
Well, then ironically enough, one of the greatest forces against communism in the world, the

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,360
Catholic Church, according to your thesis, would seem to be pushing us directly into

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,840
the hands of the communists because they are against birth control.

56
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
Well, I think this strange paradox probably is true.

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,880
It's an extraordinary situation, actually, I mean, one has to look at it, of course,

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,320
from a biological point of view, the whole essence of biological life on earth is a question

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
of balance.

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,040
And what we have done is to practice death control in a most intensive manner, without

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,400
balancing this with the birth control at the other end.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Obviously the birth rates remain as high as they were, and death rates have fallen substantially.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,920
All right, then, so much for the time being anyway for overpopulation, another force that

64
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,520
is diminishing our freedoms.

65
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,880
Well, another force which I think is very strongly operative in this country is the

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,160
force of what may be called overorganization.

67
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,400
As technology becomes more and more complicated, it becomes necessary to have more and more

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,000
elaborate organizations, more hierarchical organizations, and incidentally, the advance

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,840
of technology has been accompanied by an advance in the science of organization.

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,220
It's now possible to make organizations on a larger scale than was ever possible before.

71
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,080
And so that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in

72
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,000
these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracies, either the bureaucracies of big business or

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,400
the bureaucracies of big government.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,880
Now the devices that you were talking about, are there specific devices or methods of communication

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,920
which diminish our freedoms in addition to overpopulation and overorganization?

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,280
Well, there are certainly devices which can be used in this way.

77
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,480
I mean, let us take, after all, a piece of very recent and very painful history, is the

78
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,160
propaganda used by Hitler, which was incredibly effective.

79
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
What were Hitler's methods?

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,560
Hitler used terror on the one kind, brute force on the one hand.

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:34,720
But he also used a very efficient form of propaganda, which he was using every modern

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
device at that time.

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,940
He didn't have TV, but he had the radio, which he used to the fullest extent, and was able

84
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,640
to impose his will on an immense mass of people.

85
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,160
I mean, the Germans were a highly educated people.

86
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,200
Well, we're aware of all this, but how do you equate Hitler's use of propaganda with

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,000
the way that propaganda, if you will, is used, let us say, here in the United States?

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,120
Are you suggesting that there is a parallel?

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
No.

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Needless to say, it's not being used in this way now.

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,520
But the point is, it seems to me, that there are methods at present available, methods

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,880
superior in some respects to Hitler's methods, which could be used in a bad situation.

93
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,400
I mean, what I feel very strongly is that we mustn't be caught by surprise by our own

94
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
advancing technology.

95
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,840
This has happened again and again in history.

96
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Technology has advanced, and this changes social conditions.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,640
And suddenly, people have found themselves in a situation which they didn't foresee,

98
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,120
and doing all sorts of things they didn't really want to do.

99
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Well, now, what do you mean?

100
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,960
Do you mean that we develop our television, but we don't know how to use it correctly?

101
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
Is that the point that you're making?

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
Well, at present, the television, I think, is being used quite harmlessly.

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,860
It's being used, I think.

104
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,040
I would feel it's being used too much to distract everybody all the time.

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,120
But I mean, imagine, which must be the situation in all communist countries, where the television,

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,980
where it exists, is always saying the same thing the whole time.

107
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,120
It's always driving along.

108
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,060
It's not creating a wide front of distraction.

109
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,720
It's creating a one-pointed drumming in of a single idea all the time.

110
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,960
It's obviously an immensely powerful instrument.

111
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,160
So you're talking about the potential misuse of the instrument.

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Exactly.

113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,120
We have, of course, all technologies in itself morally neutral.

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,920
These are just powers which can either be used well or ill.

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,740
It's the same thing with atomic energy.

116
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,160
We can either use it to blow ourselves up, or we can use it as a substitute for the coal

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,760
and the oil, which are running out.

118
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,080
We've even written about the use of drugs in this life.

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,320
Well, now, this is a very interesting subject.

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,120
In this book that you mentioned, this book of mine, Brave New World, I postulated a substance

121
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
called soma, which was a very versatile drug.

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
It would make people feel happy in small doses.

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,560
It would make them see visions in medium doses, and it would send them to sleep in large doses.

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,200
Well, I don't think such a drug exists now, nor do I think it will ever exist, but we

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,000
do have drugs which will do some of these things.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,480
And I think it's quite on the cards that we may have drugs which will profoundly change

127
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
our mental states without doing us any harm.

128
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,040
I mean, this is the pharmacological revolution which has taken place, that we have now powerful

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,520
mind-changing drugs which, physiologically speaking, are almost costless.

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,120
I mean, they are not like opium or like coca, cocaine, which do change the state of mind

131
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,200
but leave terrible results physiologically and morally.

132
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Mr. Huxley, in your new essays, you state that these various enemies of freedom are

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,200
pushing us toward a real-life Brave New World, and you say that it's awaiting us just around

134
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,620
the corner.

135
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,840
First of all, can you detail for us what life in this Brave New World which you fear so

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,360
much of, what life might be like?

137
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,800
Well, to start with, I think this kind of the dictatorship of the future, I think, would

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,880
be very unlike the dictatorships which we've been familiar with in the immediate past.

139
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,440
I mean, take another book prophesying the future, which was a very remarkable book,

140
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
George Orwell's 1984.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,640
Well, this book was written at the height of the Stalinist regime and just after the

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,720
Hitler regime, and there he foresaw a dictatorship using entirely the methods of terror, the

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,600
methods of physical violence.

144
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Now, I think what is going to happen in the future is the dictators will find, as the

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,360
old saying goes, that you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them.

146
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,440
If you want to preserve your power indefinitely, you have to get the consent of the ruled,

147
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,840
and this they will do, partly by drugs, as I foresaw in Brave New World, partly by these

148
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,480
new techniques of propaganda.

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,840
They will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man and appealing to his subconscious

150
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:25,560
and his deeper emotions, and his physiology even, and so making him actually love his

151
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
slavery.

152
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,520
I mean, I think this is the danger, that actually people may be in some ways happy under the

153
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,160
new regime, but they will be happy in a situation where they oughtn't to be happy.

154
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
Let me ask you this.

155
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,240
You're talking about a world that could take place within the confines of a totalitarian

156
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
state.

157
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,940
Let's become more immediate, more urgent about it.

158
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,040
We believe, anyway, that we live in democracy here in the United States.

159
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,360
Do you believe that this Brave New World that you talk about could, let's say in the next

160
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,720
quarter century, the next century, could come here to our shores?

161
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I think it could.

162
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,160
I mean, that's why I feel it's so extremely important here and now to start thinking about

163
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,120
these problems, not to let ourselves be taken by surprise by the new advances in technology.

164
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, for example, in regard to the use of the drugs, we know there's enough evidence

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,040
now for us to be able, on the basis of this evidence, and using a certain amount of creative

166
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,120
imagination to foresee the kind of uses which could be made by people of bad will with these

167
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,840
things, and to attempt to forestall this.

168
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,180
And in the same way, I think, with these other methods of propaganda, we can foresee and

169
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:57,320
we can do a good deal to forestall, I mean, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

170
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,400
You write in Enemies of Freedom, you write specifically about the United States.

171
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,400
You say this, writing about American political campaigns, you say all that is needed is money

172
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,700
and a candidate who can be coached to look sincere.

173
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,260
Political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance.

174
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,440
The personality of the candidate, the way he is projected by the advertising experts,

175
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,000
are the things that really matter.

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,180
Well, this is, during the last campaign, there was a great deal of this kind of statement

177
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,000
by the advertising managers of the campaign parties, this idea that the candidates had

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,240
to be merchandised as though they were soap or toothpaste, and that you had to depend

179
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
entirely on the personality.

180
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,120
I mean, the personality is important, but there are certainly people with an extremely

181
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,440
amiable personality, particularly on TV, who might not necessarily be very good in positions

182
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
of political trust.

183
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Well, do you feel that men like Eisenhower, Stevenson, Nixon, with knowledge of forethought,

184
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,440
were trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American public?

185
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:15,960
No, but they were being advised by powerful advertising agencies who were making campaigns

186
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,880
of a quite different kind from what had been made before.

187
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,040
And I think we shall see probably all kinds of new devices coming into the picture.

188
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,760
I mean, for example, this thing which got a good deal of publicity last autumn, a subliminal

189
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
projection.

190
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,160
I mean, as it stands, this thing, I think, is of no menace to us at the moment.

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,660
But I was talking the other day to one of the people who has done most experimental

192
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,240
work in the psychological laboratory with this, who was saying precisely this, that

193
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,240
it is not at the moment a danger, but once you've established a principle that something

194
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,700
works, you can be absolutely sure that the technology of it is going to improve steadily.

195
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,480
And I mean, his view of the subject was that, well, maybe they will use it to some extent

196
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,660
in the 1960 campaign, but they will probably use it a good deal and much more effectively

197
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,920
in the 1964 campaign, because this is the kind of rate at which technology advances.

198
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,900
And we'll be persuaded to vote for a candidate that we do not know that we are being persuaded

199
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
to vote for.

200
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Exactly.

201
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,680
I mean, this is the rather alarming nature, that you're being persuaded below the level

202
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,640
of choice and reason.

203
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,560
In regard to advertising, which you mentioned just a little ago, in your writing, particularly

204
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,200
in Enemies of Freedom, you attack Madison Avenue, which controls most of our television

205
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,960
and radio advertising, newspaper advertising, and so forth.

206
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,000
Why do you consistently attack the advertising agency?

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, no.

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,600
I think that advertisement plays a very necessary role, but the danger, it seems to me, in a

209
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
democracy is this.

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
I mean, what does a democracy depend on?

211
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,320
A democracy depends on the individual voter making an intelligent and rational choice

212
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,960
for what he regards as his enlightened self-interest in any given circumstance.

213
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,640
But what these people are doing, I mean, both for their particular purposes, for selling

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:21,240
goods and the dictatorial propagandist are doing, is to try to bypass the rational side

215
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,840
of man and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below the surface, so that you are

216
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,640
in a way making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure, which is based on conscious choice

217
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,040
on rational grounds.

218
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Of course, well, maybe you have just answered this next question, because in your essay,

219
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,400
you write about television commercials, not just political commercials, but television

220
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,640
commercials as such, and how, as you put it, today's children walk around singing beer

221
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,180
commercials and toothpaste commercials, and then you link this phenomenon in some way

222
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,160
with the dangers of a dictatorship.

223
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Now, could you spell out the connection, or do you feel that you have done so sufficiently?

224
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,640
Well, I mean, here, this whole question of children, I think, is a terribly important

225
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,120
one, because the children are quite clearly much more suggestible than the average grown-up.

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:20,280
And again, suppose that for one reason or another, all the propaganda was in the hands

227
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,560
of one or very few agencies, you would have an extraordinarily powerful force playing

228
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,040
on these children, who, after all, are going to grow up and be adults quite soon.

229
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,040
I do think that this is not an immediate threat, but it remains a possible threat.

230
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,800
You said something to the effect in your essay that the children of Europe used to be called

231
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,440
cannon fodder, and here in the United States, they are television and radio fodder.

232
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,760
Well, after all, you can read in the trade journals the most political accounts of how

233
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,400
necessary it is to get hold of the children, because then they will be loyal brand buyers

234
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
later on.

235
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,020
But I mean, again, you just translate this into political terms.

236
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,720
The dictator says they will be loyal ideology buyers when they're grown up.

237
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,360
We hear so much about brainwashing as used by the communists.

238
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,520
Do you see any brainwashing other than that, which we've just been talking about, that

239
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,120
is used here in the United States, are the forms of brainwashing?

240
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,440
Not in the form that has been used in China and in Russia, because this is essentially

241
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,840
the application of propaganda methods, the most violent kind, to individuals.

242
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,360
It's not a shotgun method like the advertising method.

243
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,980
It's a way of getting hold of the person and playing both on his physiology and his psychology

244
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,080
until he really breaks down, and then you can implant a new idea in his head.

245
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,480
I mean, the descriptions of the methods are really blood-curdling when you read them.

246
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,400
And not only the methods apply to political prisoners, but the methods apply, for example,

247
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,040
to the training of the young communist administrators and missionaries.

248
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,700
They receive an incredibly tough kind of training, which may cause about 25% of them to break

249
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:19,080
down or commit suicide, but produces 75% of completely one-pointed phonetics.

250
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,160
The question, of course, that keeps coming back to my mind is this.

251
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,340
Obviously politics in themselves are not evil, television is not in itself evil, atomic energy

252
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,560
is not evil, and yet you seem to fear that it will be used in an evil way.

253
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,100
Why is it that the right people will not, in your estimation, use them?

254
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,000
Why is it that the wrong people will use these various devices and for the wrong motives?

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,440
Well, I think one of the reasons is that these are all instruments for obtaining power, and

256
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,080
obviously the passion for power is one of the most moving passions that exist in man,

257
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,920
and after all, all democracies are based on the proposition that power is very dangerous

258
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,340
and that it's extremely important not to let any one man or any one small group have too

259
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,200
much power for too long a time.

260
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,880
After all, what are the British and American constitutions except devices for limiting

261
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,960
power?

262
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,380
And all these new devices are extremely efficient instruments for the imposition of power by

263
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,480
small groups over larger masses.

264
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, you ask this question yourself in Enemies of Freedom, I'll put your own question back

265
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to you.

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,440
You ask this.

267
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,840
In an age of accelerating overpopulation, of accelerating over organization, and ever

268
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:53,640
more efficient means of mass communication, how can we preserve the integrity and reassert

269
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,220
the value of the human individual?

270
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,160
You put the question.

271
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,880
Now here's your chance to answer it, Mr. Huxley.

272
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,800
Well, this is obviously, first of all, it's a question of education.

273
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,760
I think it's terribly important to insist on individual values.

274
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,520
I mean, what is, there is a tendency, as you probably read a book by White, The Organization

275
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,640
Man, a very interesting, valuable book, I think, where he speaks about the new type

276
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,480
of group morality, group ethic, which speaks about the group as though the group were somehow

277
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,180
more important than the individual.

278
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,240
But this seems, as far as I'm concerned, to be in contradiction with what we know about

279
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,400
the genetical makeup of human beings, that every human being is unique.

280
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,820
And it is, of course, on this genetical basis that the whole idea of the value of freedom

281
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,300
is based.

282
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,160
And I think it's extremely important for us to stress this in all our educational life.

283
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,640
And I would say it's also very important to teach people to be on their guard against

284
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,600
the sort of verbal booby traps into which they're always being led, to analyze the kind

285
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,480
of things that are said to them.

286
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,960
Well, I think there is this whole educational side, and I think there are many more things

287
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,600
that one could do to strengthen people and to make them more aware of what was being

288
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
done.

289
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,240
You're a prophet of decentralization.

290
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,200
Well, yes, if this is feasible.

291
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,920
It's one of the tragedies, it seems to me.

292
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,780
I mean, many people have been talking about the importance of decentralization.

293
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:41,500
In order to give back to the voter a sense of direct power, I mean, the voter in an enormous

294
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,720
electorate feels quite impotent, and his vote seems to count for nothing.

295
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,980
This is not true where the electorate is small and where he is dealing with a group which

296
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,240
he can manage and understand.

297
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,040
And if one can, as Jefferson, after all, suggested, break up the units into smaller and smaller

298
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,240
units, and so get a real self-governing democracy.

299
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,800
Well, that was all very well in Jefferson's day, but how can we revamp our economic system

300
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,000
and decentralize, and at the same time, meet militarily and economically the tough challenge

301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,920
of a country like Soviet Russia?

302
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,980
Well, I think the answer to that is that there are, it seems to me that the industrial production

303
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
is of two kinds.

304
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,920
I mean, there are some kinds of industrial production which obviously need the most tremendously

305
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,760
high centralization, like the making of automobiles, for example.

306
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,000
But there are many other kinds where you could decentralize quite easily and probably quite

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,160
economically, and that you would then have this kind of decentralized life.

308
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,800
After all, you begin to see it now if you travel through the South, this decentralized

309
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,120
textile industry which is springing up there.

310
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,840
Mr. Huxley, let me ask you this, quite seriously.

311
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,400
Is freedom necessary?

312
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,280
As far as I'm concerned, it is, yes.

313
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Why?

314
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,560
Is it necessary for a productive society?

315
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,960
Yes, I should say it is.

316
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean, a genuinely productive society, I mean, I think you could produce plenty of

317
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,000
goods without much freedom, but I think the whole sort of creative life of man is ultimately

318
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,120
impossible without a considerable measure of individual freedom, of initiative, creation,

319
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,000
all these things which we value, and I think value properly, are impossible without a large

320
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
measure of freedom.

321
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,640
Well, Mr. Huxley, take a look again at the country which is in the stance of our opponent

322
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,360
anyway it would seem to be there, Soviet Russia.

323
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,220
It is strong and getting stronger economically, militarily.

324
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,800
At the same time, it's developing its art forms pretty well.

325
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:12,200
It seems not unnecessarily to squelch the creative urge among its people, and yet it

326
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,520
is not a free society.

327
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,520
It's not a free society, but here is something very interesting, that those members of the

328
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,580
society, like the scientists who are doing the creative work, are given far more freedom

329
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
than anybody else.

330
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,120
I mean, it's a privileged, aristocratic society in which, provided that they don't poke their

331
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:39,080
noses into political affairs, these people are given a great deal of prestige, a considerable

332
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
amount of freedom, and a lot of money.

333
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,080
I mean, this is a very interesting fact about the new Soviet regime, and I think what we're

334
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:57,760
going to see is people on the whole with very little freedom, but with an oligarchy on top

335
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,840
enjoying a considerable measure of freedom, and a very high standard of living.

336
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,600
And the people down below, the epsilons down below.

337
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,560
Enjoying very little.

338
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,140
And you think that that kind of situation can long endure?

339
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,560
I think it can certainly endure much longer than the situation in which everybody is kept

340
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,520
down, because I mean, they can certainly get their technological and scientific results

341
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,360
on such a basis.

342
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,160
Well, the next time that I talk to you then, perhaps we should investigate further the

343
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,200
possibility of the establishment of that kind of a society, where the drones work for the

344
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,840
queen bees up above.

345
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Well, yes, but I must say I still believe in democracy, if we can make the best of the

346
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,440
creative activities of the people on top, plus those of the people on the bottom, so

347
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
much the better.

348
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Mr. Huxley, I surely thank you for spending this half hour with us, and I wish you godspeed,

349
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
sir.

350
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,760
Thank you.

351
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,200
Aldous Huxley finds himself these days in a peculiar and disturbing position.

352
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,900
A quarter of a century after prophesying an authoritarian state in which people were reduced

353
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,840
to cyphers, he can point at Soviet Russia and say, I told you so.

354
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,960
The crucial question as he sees it now is whether the so-called free world is shortly

355
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,680
going to give Mr. Huxley the further dubious satisfaction of saying the same thing about

356
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,120
us.

357
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Stay tuned for a preview of next week's interview.

358
00:27:32,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Until then, Mike Wallace, good night.

359
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:10,440
Good night.
