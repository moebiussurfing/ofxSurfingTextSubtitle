1
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,640
Sometimes,
reality is too complex

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,110
for oral communication

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,690
But legend embodies it
in a form

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,790
which enables it to spread
all over the world

5
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,440
It was 24.17, Oceanic Time

6
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,510
when I approached
the suburbs of Alphaville

7
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,520
Silence. Logic.
Security. Prudence

8
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,660
My paper reserved
a room for me:

9
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,400
-You are?
-lvan Johnson

10
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,070
-Which paper?
-Figaro-Pravda

11
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,370
Room 344. Have you registered
at Residents Control?

12
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,080
You must, even if you're
a Festival visitor

13
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,710
Your bag, sir

14
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,840
-Please, sir.
-Nothing. Get lost

15
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,580
This way, sir

16
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,960
You're tired, sir?

17
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,520
You wish to sleep, sir?

18
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
It's this way, sir

19
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,810
If you're tired,
you can rest, sir

20
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,800
Here it is, sir

21
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,580
The bedroom's here, sir

22
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,840
-What are you looking for now?
-I'm checking if the Bible's here

23
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,110
-Everyone has one.
-Do you believe that?

24
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,880
Yes, of course

25
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,320
I'll leave you the tranquillizers
in the bathroom

26
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm very well.
Thank you so very much

27
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,160
-Are you going to take a bath, sir?
-Yes, I must reflect

28
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,700
I'll help you, sir

29
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,150
And your tie, sir

30
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,630
-Now what? -I'll take a bath
with you, sir, if you like

31
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,070
Listen, doll, I'm a big boy

32
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,230
I can find dames all alone

33
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,110
Now get lost

34
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,410
Be polite to the ladies,
Mr. Johnson

35
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,250
Shit. Now what?

36
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,080
This kid doesn't please you?

37
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,990
And your sister, sir?

38
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,350
-I'm getting out of shape.
-What sir?

39
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,350
What's going on here?
Are you on drugs or what?

40
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,920
No, it's normal, sir

41
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,500
All things weird are normal
in this whore of cities

42
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,030
Sit in that chair

43
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,880
Her name was Beatrice

44
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,320
She said she was a seductress,
third class

45
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,160
I was struck by the sadness
and durability of her face

46
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,940
Something's not in orbit
in the capital of this Galaxy

47
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,970
Hold this up

48
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,220
Not bad for a veteran
of Guadalcanal

49
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,190
Just what I was thinking
about you

50
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,860
Go play your games
with someone else

51
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,370
I've heard it before

52
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,710
Y es? Mr. Johnson

53
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,520
Miss Natasha Vonbraun
calls for you

54
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,990
Just a moment, please

55
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,730
Leonard Von Braun, inventor
of the death ray

56
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
bring back alive, or liquidate

57
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,470
Tell her to wait,
I'll be down in 5 minutes

58
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,980
She's on her way up

59
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,450
Henry Dickson, Agent X21,
12, Enrico Fermi, Alphaville

60
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,570
Got a light?

61
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,980
I've traveled 9,000 kilometers
to give it to you

62
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,650
-I'm Natasha Vonbraun.
-Yes, I know

63
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,790
How do you know?

64
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,590
You are Miss Vonbraun

65
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,720
Yes, I'm very well,
thank you so very much

66
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,000
You come from the Outlands,
Mr. Johnson?

67
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,070
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yes

68
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,050
I've been ordered to stay

69
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,210
during your stay in Alphaville

70
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,280
Who ordered you?

71
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
The authorities, of course

72
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,990
You came for the festival,
Mr. Johnson?

73
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,600
Which festival?

74
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,230
The big one; that's why people
from the Outlands come

75
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,480
-ln my opinion, it's silly
you did not. -Why?

76
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,680
The festival's nearly over;
No more until next year

77
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
You don't say

78
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,130
Y es, Mr Johnson

79
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,300
But this evening,
there's a gala reception

80
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,410
Very big

81
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,820
At a ministry. I'm going;
come if you like

82
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,520
O.K.

83
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,530
What time? I must attend
to something else first

84
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,840
You must go to
Residents Control registration?

85
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,270
No. What's that?

86
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,900
You mustn't forget to go there,
Mr Johnson. We can meet afterwards

87
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,570
No, I'll go there tomorrow.
First I must meet a friend

88
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,340
Me too, I've work to do

89
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,940
I'll give you the address
where I'll be

90
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,020
Call for me
and we'll go together

91
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,480
O.K. In an hour or two

92
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,690
All right, see you later,
Mr. Johnson

93
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,590
I'll go down with you, miss

94
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,380
Mr. Johnson, what's it like
in the Outlands?

95
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,710
You've never been?

96
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,340
No, but my father told me about
them when I was little

97
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Now it's forbidden to think
about them

98
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,550
Are you often ordered
to stay with strangers?

99
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,460
-Yes, it's my job.
-Sometimes, it must be nice

100
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,220
-Why?
-You never have love affairs?

101
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,960
-What? -Has no one ever fallen
in love with you?

102
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,200
In love? What's that?

103
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,240
There's one thing I'd like
to know, miss

104
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,680
-Yes, Mr. Johnson.
-You've finished taking me

105
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,320
-for an ass, or are you beginning?
-Let go of me

106
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,310
But answer me

107
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,290
I don't understand,
what are you talking about?

108
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,150
Realize, Princess. I don't know
what you're talking about either

109
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,440
It's always like that.
You never understand anything

110
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,450
Y es, it's always like that.
You never understand anything

111
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,360
And one night,
you end it in death

112
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,010
-Which way are you going?
-12, Enrico Fermi

113
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,040
That's after Heisenberg Boulevard,
not far from Mathematical Park

114
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,520
I have a car, I can give you
a lift, if you wish. -O.K.

115
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,490
I'll get the keys

116
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,200
-You don't want me to court you?
-What?

117
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,400
You really don't know
what it means?

118
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,510
Her smile and her small,
pointed teeth

119
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,410
reminded me of the old
vampire films

120
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,950
the sort they used to show
at cinerama museums

121
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,780
I'm a programmer, second class

122
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,650
Natasha's a name from the past

123
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,660
Y es, but in life, one can
only know the present

124
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,920
No one's lived in the past,
or will live in the future

125
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,460
Thanks for the lift, anyway

126
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,510
It's a pleasure to do my job,
Mr. Johnson

127
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,000
It's much farther?

128
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,020
You know we must cross
the North Zone, Miss

129
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,050
What's the population
of Alphaville?

130
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,660
Don't forget, you must go
to Residents Control

131
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,820
Yes

132
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,520
What exactly do you do
for a living?

133
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,130
I work

134
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,430
for a newspaper

135
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,270
Professor Vonbraun is
your father?

136
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,080
It's vital that I write about him;
Could you arrange a meeting?

137
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,190
I don't know. I've never seen him.
I'll ask

138
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,350
Finally, I leave you

139
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,790
-Here?
-I've changed my mind

140
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,160
You have the address?

141
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,600
Yes. Tell him to stop

142
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,310
Telecommunication

143
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,840
I'd like to telecommunicate

144
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,710
-Galaxy or local call?
-Local

145
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,510
Cabin 2

146
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,830
Miss, do you know that man?

147
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,300
Of course I know him.
Don't be stupid

148
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,230
At the end of Galata Bridge

149
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,170
one finds the Red Star.
My place

150
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,670
You can't compare it

151
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:45,150
to our splendid
galactic corridors

152
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:53,050
all a-glitter with
luxury and light

153
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,330
It's only a vast labyrinth,
tall, cramped

154
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,130
Is this the Red Star Hotel?

155
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,600
Y es, it is, thank you

156
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,510
-ls Mr. Dickson in?
-He's out

157
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,310
Fine, I'll wait

158
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,280
You have money, sir?

159
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,720
You can have a seat, sir,
if you're tired

160
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,460
I wanted to see it again

161
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,370
the tomb of
the Duc de Montpensier

162
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,310
The reclining statue
of the Prince

163
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,420
is the work of Pradier

164
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,050
The Prince wears
the costume of

165
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,410
Henry, it's me!

166
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,850
We've got plenty to talk about

167
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,420
-Where's my key?
-Where's my money, Mr. Dickson?

168
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,930
-My key.
-His key

169
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,940
And a beer

170
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,070
And me?

171
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,220
Why don't you hurry up
and commit suicide?

172
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,730
We need the room for our cousin
from the south

173
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,540
You come from the Outlands?

174
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,110
Why did he ask
if you'd commit suicide?

175
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,880
There's quite a few...

176
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,060
There's quite a few who do

177
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,900
One can't adapt to this place

178
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,270
It's the method
the Chinese invented

179
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,710
about thirty years ago
in Pekingville

180
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,250
Dissuasion is their strong point

181
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,320
What about those who won't adapt,
or commit suicide?

182
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,820
-Those... they're executed.
-Y es, the authorities

183
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,230
But one can hide, you know.
There aren't many left

184
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
Dick Tracy, is he dead?

185
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,670
And Guy Leclair?

186
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,310
Why didn't we hear from them,
or from you, Henry?

187
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,990
I'm sorry.
These things happen

188
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,300
And what's Alpha 60?

189
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,130
A giant computer, like they used
to have in big business

190
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,570
Nueva York... lBM...

191
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,840
Olivetti... General Electric...
Tokyorama...

192
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,850
Alpha 60 is one hundred and fifty
light years more powerful

193
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,060
I see. People have become slaves
of probabilities

194
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,160
Their ideal here, in Alphaville

195
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:30,900
is a technocracy, like that
of termites and ants

196
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,800
I don't understand

197
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,870
Probably one hundred and fifty
light years ago

198
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,750
One hundred and fifty,
two hundred

199
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,820
there were artists
in the ant society

200
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,860
Artists, novelists,
musicians, painters

201
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,460
Today, no more

202
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,970
Nothing. Like here

203
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,240
Has Professor Vonbraun
organized it all?

204
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,870
He obeys logical orders

205
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,240
Then why didn't you kill him?

206
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,120
"Why"... what does that word mean?
I forgot...

207
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,600
You know his daughter, Natasha?
Who is she really?

208
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,450
It was him they sent
to Los Alamos

209
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,730
His name wasn't that then

210
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,390
Answer! That wasn't his name
in those days

211
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,680
Listen, Henry

212
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,920
We'll get out together; you'll
be O.K. But first you must...

213
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
It's a terrible secret, but...

214
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,640
Come in, Madame la Marquise

215
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,450
My coat, Madame Recamier

216
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,390
Thank you, Madame Pompadour

217
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,500
Madame Bovary, Marie Antoinette

218
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,170
Madame Lafayette

219
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,130
Madame, it's love

220
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,800
I'll say it in Russian

221
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,200
So young and me

222
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,890
Lemmy... conscience...

223
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Alpha 60... make...
self destruct...

224
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,040
Tenderness...

225
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,200
Save those who weep

226
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,460
Yes, yes, that's it

227
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,870
The Capital of Pain

228
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,190
14, Light Radiation.
lnstitute of General Semantics

229
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,380
You know where it is?

230
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,460
You prefer I pass through
the North Zone or the South?

231
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,530
What's the difference?

232
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,560
There's snow in the North

233
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,930
and sun in the South

234
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,000
Anyway, it's my journey
to the end of the night

235
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,340
So, it doesn't matter

236
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,920
It was my first night
in Alphaville

237
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,350
but it seemed to me that
centuries had passed

238
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm very well, thank you
so very much

239
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,390
Miss Natasha Vonbraun

240
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,190
-Which section?
-Programming and memory

241
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,950
The Central Memory...

242
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,560
...is thus named...

243
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,460
...because of
the primordial role...

244
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,800
...that it plays...

245
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:25,150
...in the logic-organization
within Alpha 60

246
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,180
But no one has lived
in the past...

247
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,820
...and no one will live
in the future

248
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,530
The present is the form
of all life

249
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,270
This quality...

250
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,230
...cannot be changed by any means

251
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,370
Time is like a circle...

252
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,620
...which turns endlessly

253
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,350
The descending arc is the past

254
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,390
The arc that climbs
is the future

255
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,900
Everything has been said...

256
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,400
...provided words do not change
their meanings...

257
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,780
...and meanings their words

258
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:36,440
Is it not obvious that someone...

259
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,680
...who customarily lives...

260
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,480
...in a state of suffering...

261
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,520
...requires a different sort
of religion...

262
00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:01,230
...from a person habitually
in a state of well-being?

263
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,910
Before us, nothing existed here

264
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,570
No one

265
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,580
We are totally alone here

266
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,390
We are unique,
dreadfully unique

267
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,870
The meaning of words...

268
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,400
...and of expressions,
is no longer grasped

269
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,140
An isolated word, or a detail
of a design...

270
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,940
...can be understood

271
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,080
But the meaning
of the whole escapes

272
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,130
Once we know the number one...

273
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,540
...we believe that we know
the number two...

274
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:11,140
...because one plus one
equals two

275
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,150
We forget that first...

276
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:23,290
...we must know
the meaning of plus

277
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,580
I'm going

278
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,860
The acts of men...

279
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,430
...carried over...

280
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,860
...from past centuries...

281
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,060
...will gradually...

282
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,670
...destroy them...

283
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,840
...logically...

284
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,710
l, Alpha 60...

285
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:56,380
...am merely the logical means
of this destruction

286
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,970
Good night, Comrade

287
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,710
I thought I'd never

288
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,020
-Shall we go?
-I'll get the keys

289
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,260
I left because I couldn't
understand a word he was saying

290
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,430
But it's very simple

291
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,430
We learnt this evening

292
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,000
that death and life

293
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,270
are found within
the same circle

294
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,650
-Are you afraid of death?
-Of course not. Why?

295
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,860
We took the tangent
to the center districts

296
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,690
Traffic bulletins on the radio...

297
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,330
...as Natasha spoke to me
in her pretty sphinx voice

298
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,870
Pretty sphinx...

299
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,910
Foreign ambassadors
usually attend

300
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,750
or delegations
from the districts

301
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,050
Why does everyone
look so sad, somber?

302
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,190
You ask too many questions

303
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,300
Because they lack electricity

304
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,700
The essence...

305
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,400
...of the so-called
capitalist word...

306
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,270
...or the communist world...

307
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,840
...is not an evil volition...

308
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:12,120
...to subject their people
by the power of indoctrination...

309
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,100
...or the power of finance...

310
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,760
...but simply...

311
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,760
...the natural ambition...

312
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,660
...of any organization...

313
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,930
...to plan all its actions

314
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,710
In a word, to minimize
unknown quantities

315
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,250
This dump of yours isn't
Alphaville, it's Zeroville

316
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,730
-What are we going to see?
-I don't know, light and sound

317
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,980
-Where is everyone?
-I believe; it's already begun

318
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,770
Hurry. We're late

319
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,990
It's already begun

320
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,490
Don't they electrocute them
any more?

321
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,440
Darling, you know the provisions
of 17th Plan took a plunge

322
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,970
You see, I told you so

323
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,390
Stay here

324
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,770
-lntroduce me.
-I told you to stay there

325
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,410
we're with very important people

326
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
-Can I take a photo?
-I'll ask

327
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,920
Yes

328
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,410
-What have they done?
-They've been condemned

329
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,450
Only men?

330
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,190
There's usually a ratio of
fifty men executed to one woman

331
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,400
But what have they done?

332
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,190
They behaved illogically

333
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,400
lsn't that a crime
in the Outlands?

334
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:24,240
Say, I know him.
He wept when his wife died

335
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,370
He was condemned for that?

336
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,680
Evidently

337
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,450
We must advance to live

338
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,920
Aim straight for those you love

339
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,750
Listen to me, normals

340
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,930
We see the truth
you no longer see

341
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:25,230
The truth is that the essence
of man is love and faith

342
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,100
courage, tenderness,
generosity and sacrifice

343
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,710
The rest is the obstacle created

344
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,970
by the progress
of your blind ignorance

345
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,610
One day...

346
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,190
One day...

347
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,400
Sorry, Professor,
but I must speak with you

348
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,230
I never speak to journalists

349
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,570
I'm not a journalist
Can't we talk somewhere quieter?

350
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,550
-Goodbye, sir.
-Mr. Nosferatu

351
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,620
That man no longer exists

352
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,950
Are you crying?

353
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,290
No, because it's forbidden

354
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,450
Occupied

355
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,790
Occupied

356
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,530
Free

357
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,110
Sit there and answer when
you're spoken to

358
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,510
I haven't done anything

359
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,010
Newcomers must be interrogated

360
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,520
Alpha 5

361
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,520
What is your name?

362
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,770
Where were you born?

363
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,800
Nueva York

364
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,230
How old are you?

365
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,410
I don't know... 45

366
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,680
What make is your car?

367
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,890
What do you love above all?

368
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,730
Gold and women

369
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,030
What are you doing in Alphaville?

370
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,130
An article for Figaro-Pravda

371
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,410
You seem afraid

372
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,040
I'm not afraid...
not the way you think

373
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,250
Anyway, you wouldn't understand

374
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,420
Rest assured that my decisions...

375
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,880
...always have in view...

376
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,160
...the ultimate good

377
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,760
I shall now...

378
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,430
...ask you some test questions...

379
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,270
...as a security measure

380
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,940
No, go ahead

381
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,840
You have come from the Outlands

382
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,090
What were your feelings...

383
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:12,590
...when you passed through
galactic space?

384
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,430
The silence of infinite space

385
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,930
appalled me

386
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,460
What is the privilege
of the dead?

387
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,630
To die no more

388
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:34,150
Do you know what illuminates
the night?

389
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,550
Poetry

390
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,210
What is your religion?

391
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,850
I believe in the inspirations
of conscience

392
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,730
Do you make any distinction...

393
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,760
...between the mysterious
principles...

394
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,430
...of knowledge...

395
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,780
...and those of love?

396
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,610
In my opinion, in love
there is no mystery

397
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,580
You are not telling the truth

398
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,610
I don't understand

399
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,220
You are hiding certain things

400
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,160
I admit I might have
reasons to lie

401
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,390
but how can you differentiate
between lies and truth?

402
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,530
You are hiding certain things...

403
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,940
...but I do not know yet
what they are

404
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:52,250
For the time being, you are free

405
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,160
I should like you to visit...

406
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,540
...the Control Complex

407
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,240
Come with me, Mr. Johnson

408
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,610
-Where are we going?
-To the Chief Engineer

409
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,660
Ah, the day breaks

410
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,840
Sit down, Mr Johnson

411
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,950
A momentous occasion

412
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,820
Y es, we spent three years looking
for Grand Omega Minus

413
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,500
Well, Mr. Johnson...

414
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,600
How do you find Alphaville?

415
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,000
Not bad, if I knew where I was

416
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,980
You are in the center of
Alphaville, inside Alpha 60

417
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,950
The task of Alpha 60
is to calculate and project

418
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,260
the results which Alphaville
will subsequently enjoy

419
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,290
Why?

420
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,570
No one ever says "why";
one says "because"

421
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,440
In the life of individuals,
as in the life of nations

422
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,470
all is linked,
all is consequence

423
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,910
That's the famous theory of
Professor Leonard Nosferatu

424
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,350
Leonard Nosferatu no longer
exists, Mr. Johnson

425
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,860
The Outlands expelled him in 1964

426
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,930
Today there is only
Professor Vonbraun

427
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:50,570
I remember. He was sent
to a village in the desert

428
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,270
to perfect his invention

429
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,240
He was exiled, you mean

430
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,340
Now the Outlands wring their hands,
wishing him back

431
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,550
They flood us with spies. Perhaps
you are a spy, Mr. Johnson

432
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,590
You know I'm only a free man

433
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,090
A meaningless reply.
We know nothing

434
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,100
We record, calculate,
draw conclusions

435
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,970
An hour ago,
one of Alpha 60's

436
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,640
1.4 billion nerve centres
questioned you

437
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,510
Your replies were difficult and
sometimes impossible to codify

438
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,850
We deduce an above-average
intelligence

439
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,720
We are sometimes in mortal need
of superior intelligences

440
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,830
At other times we have a no less
mortal distrust of them

441
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,860
So what will you do with me?

442
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,130
For the moment, we're ordered
to show you Alpha 60

443
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,300
Who ordered you?
Professor Vonbraun?

444
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,040
Absolutely not

445
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,380
An order is a logical conclusion

446
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:17,050
One must not be afraid of logic.
Simply that. Period

447
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,160
The circuit elements...
of 183 Omega Minus... malfunction

448
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,190
Calculating or memory elements?

449
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,430
Memory

450
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,930
Professors Eckel and Jeckel

451
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,660
I'm very well, thank you,
pleased to meet you

452
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,210
Me too

453
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,110
I'd like to know what
Grand Omega Minus is

454
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,820
Our 17th electricity plan
is inadequate

455
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,860
Sooner or later, the Outlands
will declare war on us

456
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,280
Therefore, we decided
to invade them

457
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,490
Directed by Professor Vonbraun,
Omega Minus will be

458
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,960
victorious over anti-matter

459
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,600
I see, it's ideal

460
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,370
We can perhaps use men like you

461
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,840
to tell us the weak points
of the Outlands

462
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,940
Your tendency to dwell
in the past...

463
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,250
...could be useful to us

464
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,650
We send those properly brain-washed
to provoke the other galaxies

465
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,600
the strikes, revolutions,
family rows, student revolts

466
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,000
That's us: Grand Omega Minus

467
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,000
-Where now?
-The invisible part of Alpha 60

468
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,650
You think more
of what has been...

469
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,950
...than of what will be

470
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,120
It's old, your camera

471
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,760
The technical...
I don't believe in it

472
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,230
Y es, of course

473
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,130
Jeckel asked why I shot
the individual in my bathroom...

474
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,870
...when the whole thing
was just a psycho-test

475
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:20,110
I replied, because I'm too old
to argue. So I shoot

476
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,740
It's my only weapon
against fatality

477
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,950
-What's this?
-Central lnterrogation Station

478
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,920
Here Alpha 60 sets itself problems

479
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,430
The forms and references used
by Alpha 60

480
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,230
are too complex
for human understanding

481
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,670
What sort of problems?

482
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:47,100
Train and airplane departures...
movement of people and goods

483
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,710
electricity distribution...
crime suppression... war operations

484
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:58,680
Element Seven, Malfunction

485
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,380
What's happening?

486
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,320
It's war with the Outlands

487
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,350
A simple instruction...

488
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,760
...is usually insufficient...

489
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,090
...to put into...

490
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,570
...execution...

491
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:56,730
...a task set by Alpha 60

492
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,840
Do not think...

493
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,810
...that it is l...

494
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,650
...who initiate
this destruction...

495
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,620
...nor the scientists...

496
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,990
...who have accepted my plan

497
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,500
Ordinary men...

498
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,430
...are unworthy...

499
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,470
...of the positions they hold...

500
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,830
...in the world

501
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,040
Analysis of their past...

502
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:40,680
...automatically leads one...

503
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,050
...to this conclusion

504
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,680
Therefore...

505
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,420
...they must be destroyed

506
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,630
That is to say: transformed

507
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,830
I don't need anyone
to draw it for me

508
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,740
During these years,
under the direction...

509
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,820
...of Vonbraun
and his assistants...

510
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,180
...Alphaville had developed
by leaps and bounds...

511
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,350
...guided by electronic brains
that developed themselves...

512
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,550
...by conceiving problems...

513
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,720
...that the human imagination
couldn't grasp

514
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,230
Foreigners were gradually
assimilated...

515
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,360
...especially the Swedes,
Germans and Americans

516
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,040
The others, the unassimilatables
were purely and simply killed

517
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,880
I walked through the threaten
of executions

518
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,210
Usually, we would seat them

519
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:54,830
...and electrocute them in their
chairs as they watched a show

520
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:59,030
Then we'd dump them into
huge rubbish bins...

521
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,960
...and the theater was ready
for the next batch

522
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:06,000
If an individual showed hope
of reclamation...

523
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:11,140
...he was sent to a chronic
illness hospital where...

524
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:16,610
...mechanical and propagandistic
treatments soon cured him

525
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,450
I felt that my existence here...

526
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:25,020
...was becoming a distorted,
twilight memory...

527
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,990
...and without a doubt,
a terrible destiny

528
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:33,300
I was left only one solution

529
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,960
It would not be logical...

530
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,240
...to prevent...

531
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,370
...superior beings...

532
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,000
...from attacking...

533
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,150
...the other galaxies

534
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,600
344

535
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,730
Put in one token

536
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,540
Thank you

537
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,880
Going up, sir?

538
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,420
-No, I'll shine my shoes.
-Please, sir

539
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,780
-This man has the key.
-This way, sir

540
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,240
You're tired, sir?

541
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,280
You'd like to sleep, sir?

542
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,890
Y es, to sleep:
perchance to dream

543
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,890
What are you exactly?

544
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,790
I'm a seductress, third class

545
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,070
Has your colleague gone?

546
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,370
Who? Beatrice?

547
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,950
I don't know;
a blonde with long legs

548
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,310
She's working
in the peripheral flats

549
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,580
We're only replacements

550
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,160
Ever heard of the Outlands?

551
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,390
Never

552
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,670
-Get out of here!
-Why?

553
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,140
If anyone asks,
say you don't know

554
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,080
I'm very well,
thank you so very much

555
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,180
If it isn't the little princess

556
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,210
I was forbidden to come,
but I wanted to see you again

557
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,740
Not me!

558
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,420
Since you're here,
order breakfast for me

559
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,210
Yes, sir

560
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:25,120
Pardon, I'm very well,
thank you so very much

561
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,630
Me too

562
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,600
Bow your head

563
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,180
What is it?

564
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,110
Nothing. Just a thought

565
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,450
What about my breakfast?

566
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,460
I want to tele-order breakfast

567
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,860
What is your number?

568
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,390
You have a number?

569
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,160
They didn't give me one
at Alpha 60

570
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,600
Not your control number,
your room number

571
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,300
344

572
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,240
Ever heard of this book?

573
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,410
"The Capital of Pain"

574
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,850
Some words are underlined

575
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,570
We live in the void
of metamorphoses

576
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,700
But the echo that runs
throughout the day...

577
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,930
...that echo beyond time,
anguish or caress...

578
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,080
Are we near to our conscience,
or far from it?

579
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,480
These are words
I don't understand

580
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,260
Conscience...

581
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,530
And this:
death in conversation

582
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,370
And this?

583
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,920
Your eyes have returned
from a despotic land...

584
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,790
...where no one has known
the meaning of a glance

585
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,020
You've really no idea
what this is?

586
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,190
It reminds me of something

587
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,130
I don't know what

588
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,820
Naked truth

589
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,770
I know it well

590
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,000
Despair has no wings,
nor does love

591
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,110
No face, they don't speak

592
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,210
I don't look at them,
I don't speak to them

593
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,280
But I am as alive
as my love and despair...

594
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,140
And this:
Dying is not dying

595
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,280
And this:
The beguiler beguiler

596
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,580
This:
Men who change

597
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,380
Never heard of secret messages,
Miss Vonbraun?

598
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:11,520
A secret message?

599
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,700
Don't you know what a secret is?

600
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:19,740
Y es. Secrets of planning,
atomic secrets, secrets of memory

601
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,770
Now what are you looking for?
This town is driving me nuts!

602
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,840
I'm looking for a Bible,
to see if it's in it

603
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:32,280
Are you a complete idiot? The word
I'm looking for, obviously...

604
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,850
Where is it? There's always
one for every room

605
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,560
I'm becoming afraid

606
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:48,330
Since you've come, I no longer
understand what is happening

607
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,730
Me, I think I'm beginning
to understand

608
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,600
Here it is

609
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,410
"Conscience"... it's not in it

610
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,950
I'm very well, thank you

611
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,060
It's no longer there.

612
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,530
So no one here

613
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,910
knows the meaning of the word

614
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,170
Too bad

615
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,570
1 sugar or 2?

616
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,540
2

617
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,860
That's not a Bible,
it's a dictionary

618
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:54,090
lsn't it the same
in the Outlands, Mr. Johnson?

619
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,170
Answer me now, what's it for?

620
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:04,770
Nearly every day words disappear,
because they are forbidden

621
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,780
They are replaced by new words
expressing new ideas

622
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:18,690
In the last two
or three months

623
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,160
some words I was
very fond of disappeared

624
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:25,460
Which words? I'm interested

625
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,260
Redbreast, weeping

626
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,430
autumn light

627
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,940
tenderness too

628
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,940
When I'm with you I'm afraid

629
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,880
They ordered me
not to see you again

630
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:54,650
Who? The Alpha 60 engineers?

631
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,230
-Y es.
-What are you afraid of?

632
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:11,530
I'm afraid because
I know that word

633
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,040
without ever having seen it
or read it

634
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,510
-Which word?
-Le conscience

635
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,780
La conscience

636
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,520
-You've never been to the Outlands?
-No

637
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,420
Are you sure?

638
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,190
Yes

639
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,430
You're lying

640
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,430
Why are you cross with me?

641
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,870
I believe you mustn't say
"why" but "because"

642
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,540
I said "why"?

643
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:51,410
And if enemy ears are listening,
they heard you, too

644
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:01,190
Well, then, I was careless,
because it's forbidden

645
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,200
Perhaps it's all right for you
to use it

646
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,130
When did I say "why"?

647
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:17,030
Another question first:
where were you born?

648
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,730
Here in Alphaville

649
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:26,210
Another lie. Perhaps
you don't know, but you're lying

650
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,080
I must know the truth:
where were you born?

651
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,790
Here. I told you

652
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,700
No, in Tokyorama

653
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,970
the Land of the Rising Sun

654
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,300
Go on, say it

655
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,370
In Tokyorama,
in the Land of the Rising Sun

656
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,370
Or in Florence,
perhaps... where

657
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,850
try to remember it
for yourself, Natasha. Where?

658
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,580
Where? I don't know

659
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,020
Where the sky's as blue as
the South Seas

660
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:16,990
Florence, where the sky's
as blue as the South Seas

661
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,400
Or in Nueva York

662
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,370
Where the winter... Broadway

663
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:31,670
glitters in the snow
like a fur coat

664
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,580
You see, you do know
the Outlands

665
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:39,890
Your father was chased
from Nueva York in '64

666
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,650
He brought you here, so you
are not from here

667
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,800
I know what this book is

668
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,570
A man who came with us from
Nueva York, he wrote these books

669
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,140
I don't know what became of him

670
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:02,510
They live in the forbidden
quarters here; they commit suicide

671
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,280
I know that Alpha 60
uses them sometimes

672
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,880
It controls them.
How come?

673
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,820
Because they write
incomprehensible things

674
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:19,530
Now I know:
it used to be called poetry

675
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,700
It's believed to be secrets,
but really it's nothing

676
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:34,410
When Control has an hour or so free
it codifies such stuff

677
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,440
Like everything else,
one never knows

678
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,610
It can always prove useful

679
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,880
Absolutely.
We're highly organized

680
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:49,480
I'd like to leave with you
for the Outlands

681
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,900
But I'm afraid

682
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,860
Now that I've seen you
I'm no longer normal

683
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,640
When did I say "why"?

684
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,640
Why?

685
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,210
Because... you know very well,
Mr. Johnson

686
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,020
No, I don't

687
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:21,980
At which moment?
Tell me

688
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,860
Quite often. Last night
in the corridor, for instance

689
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:26,690
This time you're lying

690
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:32,300
When I said I was
falling in love with you

691
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,500
In love? What's that?

692
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,420
This

693
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,990
No, I know what that is:
it's sensuality

694
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:02,330
No, sensuality is a consequence

695
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:05,000
It cannot exist without love

696
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,810
So what is love, then?

697
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,420
Your voice, your eyes...

698
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,980
...your hands, your lips...

699
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,720
Our silences, our words...

700
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,760
Light that goes...

701
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,690
...light that returns

702
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,230
A single smile between us

703
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,680
In quest of knowledge,
I watched night create day...

704
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,870
...while we seemed unchanged

705
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,850
O beloved of all,
beloved of one alone...

706
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,020
...your mouth silently promised
to be happy

707
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:09,360
Away, away, says hate;
Closer, closer, says love

708
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,330
A caress leads us from
our infancy

709
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,470
lncreasingly I see
the human form...

710
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,970
...as a lovers' dialogue

711
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,980
The heart has but one mouth

712
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,220
Everything by chance

713
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,850
All words without thought

714
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,290
Sentiments adrift

715
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:41,600
Men roam the city

716
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:45,000
A glance, a word

717
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,800
Because I love you

718
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:51,900
Everything moves

719
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,740
We must advance to live

720
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,810
Aim straight ahead
toward those you love

721
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,790
I went toward you,
endlessly toward the light

722
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,990
If you smile, it enfolds me
all the better

723
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,130
The rays of your arms
pierce the mist

724
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,440
Capital of Sorrow

725
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,520
I must know how the chief engineer
will use me

726
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,160
As an inter-galaxy double agent,
I think

727
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,290
-So it's true what Eckel said.
-What?

728
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:50,160
You send spies to sabotage
the rest of the world

729
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,430
Of course, you learn that
in school

730
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,340
Are you going to betray me?

731
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:10,540
You can't talk
or don't you want to

732
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,350
Can I communicate with
the Outlands from this hotel?

733
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,360
Just ask for Galaxy Service.
You want me to do it?

734
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,860
The Outlands...

735
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,160
I want to telecommunicate

736
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:32,830
...telecommunications are
suspended for some days

737
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,940
-What were you going to say?
-An atomic attack on Alphaville

738
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,950
I'll explain later, Princess,
but now let's get out of here

739
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,950
We must find the Professor...
where does he live?

740
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,590
-Come with us!
-Where?

741
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,760
-Residents Control.
-No kidding

742
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,760
When he doubles up, get him

743
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,800
Story 842, Miss

744
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:06,300
One day a tiny man entered
a North Zone cafe

745
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,280
and said, "l want a cup
of very hot, sweet coffee..."

746
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:14,340
adding: "l shan't pay,
because I fear no one"

747
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,880
He drank his coffee

748
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:24,630
He left

749
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,060
He drank his coffee
and didn't pay

750
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:33,500
The cafe owner said nothing,
he was afraid of a scandal

751
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,440
But when the tiny man repeated
the trick a few times

752
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,670
the cafe owner said:
"I've had it, I'll get a tough guy

753
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:43,540
to beat up this tiny man
if he comes back"

754
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,910
So, on the fourth day

755
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:53,390
when the tiny man said, "l want
a cup of very hot, sweet coffee..."

756
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,120
the tough guy goes
to him and says:

757
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,660
"So you're afraid of no one?"

758
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,130
"That's right"

759
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,170
"Well, neither am l"

760
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,360
"Well", says the tiny man,
"Make that two cups of coffee

761
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,800
very hot and sweet."

762
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,940
Meet you outside
Residents Control

763
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,640
You'll stay here, Miss Vonbraun

764
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,430
Last night you lied

765
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,770
You organized Dickson's death.
Why?

766
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:45,340
Your name may be spelled...

767
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:48,340
...lvan Johnson...

768
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:54,440
...but it is pronounced
Lemmy Caution...

769
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,920
...secret agent...

770
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:04,360
...number zero zero three...

771
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,390
...of the Outlands

772
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:15,870
You are a menace
to the security of Alphaville

773
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,970
I refuse to become
what you call normal

774
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:25,810
Those you call mutants...

775
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:31,390
...form a race superior...

776
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,350
...to ordinary men...

777
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,890
...whom we have almost eliminated

778
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,350
Unthinkable

779
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,990
An entire race cannot
be destroyed

780
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:45,160
I shall calculate...

781
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:48,240
...so that failure...

782
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:50,400
...is impossible

783
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,230
I shall fight so that failure
is possible

784
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:02,850
Everything that I project
shall be accomplished

785
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,480
Don't be so sure;
I have a secret, too

786
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:15,590
What is your secret?
Tell me, Mr. Caution

787
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,300
Something which never changes,
day or night

788
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:28,010
The past represents its future,
it advances in a straight line

789
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,510
yet it ends by coming
full circle

790
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,720
I cannot trace it

791
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,280
I won't tell you

792
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,150
Several of my circuits...

793
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:43,520
...are looking for the solution
to your riddle

794
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,760
I will find it

795
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:51,630
If you find it, you will
destroy yourself simultaneously

796
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:55,930
because you will become
my kin, my brother

797
01:22:56,770 --> 01:23:01,580
Those who are not born,
do not weep...

798
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:05,210
...and do not regret

799
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:11,960
Thus it is logical
to condemn you to death

800
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,450
Fuck yourself with your logic

801
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:20,260
My judgement is just...

802
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,870
...and I am working for the
universal good

803
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,870
If you plan to drive us from
the other galaxies, you'll fail

804
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:39,810
You will not leave;
the exit is blocked

805
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,080
We'll see

806
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,020
Professor Vonbraun - do you
know where he lives?

807
01:24:55,230 --> 01:25:03,460
Central Palace, South Zone,
behind Raw Materials Station

808
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,000
Let's go

809
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,640
Don't budge

810
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,950
That way I'm sure you will
keep your word

811
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,020
Out! Out!
No journalists!

812
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:33,090
You know "journalist" and "justice"
both begin with the same letter?

813
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,280
Tell your boss

814
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,050
What can I do for you,
Mister Caution?

815
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,880
News travels fast here

816
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,390
Because we're very rapidly
entering Light Civilization

817
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,990
At about 300.000 kilometers
per second

818
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,320
I'm returning to the Outlands.
Come with me

819
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:19,800
Stay with us, Mister Caution

820
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:24,430
When the war's over I'll put you
in charge of another galaxy

821
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,170
You will have gold and women

822
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:45,230
We are mastering a science
so fantastic

823
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,160
that the old American and
Russian control of atomic force

824
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,270
will seem pathetic

825
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,430
I see

826
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:58,970
You oppose my moral, even
supernatural, sense of vocation

827
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,600
with a simple physical
and mental existence

828
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,010
easily controllable
by technicians

829
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,820
Your ideas are strange,
Mr. Caution

830
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,530
Some years ago,
in the Age of ldeas

831
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,400
yours would have been called
sublime ideas

832
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:43,410
Look at yourself. Men of your type
will soon be extinct

833
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:47,490
You'll become something
worse than dead

834
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,260
You'll become a legend,
Mr. Caution

835
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:53,890
Y es, I'm afraid of death

836
01:28:54,670 --> 01:29:00,300
but for a humble secret agent
that's a fact of life, like whisky

837
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,200
And I've drunk that all my life

838
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:13,470
You never want to see
the Outlands again, Professor?

839
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,120
Goodbye, Mister Caution

840
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,990
Such people will serve as
terrible examples to those...

841
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,890
...who see the world
as theater...

842
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,530
...when technical power
and its triumph...

843
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,830
...is the only act
in their repertoire

844
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,780
I was running a straight line...

845
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,260
...which, like Dickson's
Greek labyrinth...

846
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,760
...and philosophers were lost,
as a secret agent was too

847
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:26,060
In many respects...

848
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:32,080
...your reactions and your
modes of thought...

849
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,020
...differ...

850
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:39,990
...from present normality

851
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,770
The inhabitants of Alphaville
are not normal

852
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,840
They are the product of mutation

853
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:53,270
Do you accept our proposal?

854
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:58,050
Answer silently...

855
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:02,010
...with yes or no

856
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:05,760
I'll never betray the Outlands

857
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,570
The present is terrifying...

858
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:09,410
...because it is irreversible,
and because it is of iron

859
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:16,990
Time is the substance of which
I am made

860
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,550
Time is a river
which carries me along

861
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,760
But I am time

862
01:33:55,870 --> 01:34:00,670
It's a tiger, tearing me apart;
but I'm the tiger

863
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:03,800
Look at her and me,
there's your answer

864
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:06,570
We're happiness, and we're
heading towards it

865
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:12,750
It is our misfortune
that the world is reality

866
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,070
And l...

867
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:20,990
...it is my misfortune
that I am myself, Alpha 60

868
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,470
Natasha, quick...

869
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,950
...think of the word love

870
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,760
Here

871
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,700
Not all the inhabitants died,
but all were stricken

872
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:16,300
Those not asphyxiated
by the absence of light...

873
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:20,910
...circled crazily, like ants

874
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:26,640
It was 23.15, Oceanic Time...

875
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:31,020
...when Natasha and I left
Alphaville by the peripheral roads

876
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:36,660
A night drive across intersidereal
space, and we'd be home

877
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,320
Don't look back

878
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,360
-Do you think they're all dead?
-Not yet

879
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:53,070
They may recover, and Alphaville
will be happy, like Florence

880
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:56,980
Like Angouleme-city,
like Tokyorama

881
01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:00,120
You can't go back

882
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:09,420
-Have I slept for long?
-No, the space of an instant

883
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:13,330
Where are we?
In the Outlands?

884
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,000
Not yet

885
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,970
You're looking at me
with an odd face

886
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,270
You're waiting for me
to say something

887
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,010
I don't know what to say

888
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:37,710
They're words I don't know

889
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,720
I wasn't taught them

890
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:45,330
Help me

891
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,400
lmpossible, Princess.
You must get there yourself

892
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:53,260
Then you'll be saved.
If you don't

893
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,000
you're as lost
as the dead of Alphaville

894
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:02,240
l

895
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,910
you

896
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:13,180
love

897
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:16,820
I love you
